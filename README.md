# University Administration System

## This web application is meant to comprise the functionality for a generic administration system which delves into a database connecting Universities, Colleges, Streams, Students and Courses (with grade). Any given user gets to go throws all records, edit them and / or delete them. As well, a user may add new records, which will be automatically stored into an SQL database furbished and supplied with SQLAlchemy. Finally, a user may run searches across the database throw the app. 

## These three high-level functions are displayed in the next video thoroughly.

## The folder for this application is [UAS_WebApp](UAS_WebApp/); once inside this folder and with a virtual environment with python 3.7 or higher and the required libraries setup, the application runs with the following command line: `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`. If execution is running properly, open your preferred browser on `http://localhost:5000` to interact with frontend.

## [Data Model](Data_Model/) contains the mysql ERR diagram.

## [UAS_Resources](UAS_Resources.md) is a Markdown with links and references to the different technologies and concepts touched in this project. As well, it includes links to some courses, resources and tutorials. 

## [Resources & Cheatsheets](Resources_&_Cheatsheets/) contains tips and tricks for different technologies and material from courses from which this project got its basis. The [Flask Web App from Coursera](Flask_Web_App_Coursera/) folder contains the material from a [Coursera Guided Project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/python-flask) from which I based the app distribution, functionality, layout and modularity. The [Flask SQLAlchemy Basics from Pretty Print](Resources_&_Cheatsheets/flask_sqlalchemy_basics_Pretty_Print) contains useful material from [Anthony Herbert's courses website](https://prettyprinted.com/) from which I based the data models and relationships.
