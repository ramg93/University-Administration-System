# University Administration System

## This web application is meant to comprise the goals posited in the [Case Study pdf file](CaseStudy.pdf). The folder for this application is [PIP_WebApp](PIP_WebApp/); once inside this folder and with a virtual environment with python 3.7 or higher and the required libraries setup, the application runs with the following command line: `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`. If execution is running properly, open your preferred browser on `http://localhost:5000` to interact with frontend.

## [Data Model](Data_Model/) contains the mysql ERR diagram.

## [PIP-RAMG](UAS_Resources.md) is a Markdown with links and references to the different technologies and concepts touched in this project. As well, it includes links to some courses, resources and tutorials. 

## [Resources & Cheatsheets](Resources_&_Cheatsheets/) contains tips and tricks for different technologies and material from courses from which this project got its basis. The [Flask Web App from Coursera](Flask_Web_App_Coursera/) folder contains the material from a [Coursera Guided Project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/python-flask) from which I based the app distribution, functionality, layout and modularity. The [Flask SQLAlchemy Basics from Pretty Print](Resources_&_Cheatsheets/flask_sqlalchemy_basics_Pretty_Print) contains useful material from [Anthony Herbert's courses website](https://prettyprinted.com/) from which I based the data models and relationships.
